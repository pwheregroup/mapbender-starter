## Branches

The current version of Mapbender is based on the [release/3.0.6 branch](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/tree/release/3.0.5). The master branch will reflect the changes of the [current releases](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/releases) while the develop branch might contain new features.



## Components

Our code is maintained using git and hosted at Github. We split up our code into several parts:

1. mapbender-starter: The starter project you are using right now. This provides a complete application to play with and build upon.
2. [mapbender](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/tree/release/3.0.6): The CoreBundle contains all basic functionality, including base classes and interfaces for the Mapbender API usable by Mapbender and third-party bundles.
3. [FOM](https://github.com/mapbender/fom/tree/release/3.0.6): User and rights management.
4. [OWSProxy3](https://github.com/mapbender/owsproxy3/tree/release/3.0.6): OWSProxy3 is a transparent Buzz-based proxy that uses cURL for connection to web resources via/without a proxy server.
5. mapquery: Mapbender uses MapQuery as its jQuery/OpenLayers wrapper. We maintain our own clone.
